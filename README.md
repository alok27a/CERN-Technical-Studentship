-   You are a **national of a [CERN Member or Associate Member State](http://home.cern/about/member-states)**.
-   You have completed **at least 18 months of your undergraduate studies** (Bachelor's or Master’s) at the time of the next student selection round taking place.

## Required Documentation for Application
-   A  **CV**.

-   **A reference letter from your University Professor is  mandatory**.

## Motivation Letter 
``The most important part of your application is your motivation letter or Statement of Purpose (SOP). It should be unique and reflect your individuality. The tips below are merely suggestions to help you get started, but strive to make these sections as original as possible.``

Begin your motivation letter by introducing yourself and stating the position you are applying for, ensuring to start with a strong opening to grab the reader's attention. Clearly explain your passion for the field, including a personal story or experience that sparked your interest, and show how this aligns with your career goals. Highlight your relevant experiences and achievements, mentioning specific skills with concrete examples to demonstrate why you are a strong candidate. Describe what unique contributions you can bring to the organization or the team at CERN and share your vision for how you plan to utilize this opportunity if given. Demonstrate that you’ve done your research by mentioning specific aspects of the program or organization that appeal to you, and explain why it’s the perfect fit for you. Conclude by summarizing your enthusiasm for the opportunity.


## Selection Procedure After Application 

After the successful submission of an application, everyone receives an automated email from HR stating, "Your application is complete and is under review." You will typically receive this email after the deadline.

Supervisors associated with various teams at CERN (like the IT, EP, and HSE departments) need to submit project proposals and specify the number of students required. After an initial screening by HR, all candidate profiles are shared with the supervisors, who are then responsible for selecting the students.

Students are selected based on two categories:

1.  An interview is conducted for the majority of applicants. During my time, 4 out of 5 students selected from India received a selection email four months after the application deadline.
2.  An interview is not conducted for a few applicants. In my experience, only 1 out of 5 students was selected without an interview, receiving a selection email directly. However, it is highly unlikely that you will be selected if you do not receive an interview invitation.

For the interview, the questions are fairly straightforward and mainly involve a discussion about your resume and possibly the project the supervisor wants you to select.

It was also observed that most of the students selected from India for CS-related projects had made significant contributions to GSOC or other open-source projects. However, that's not the only criteria for selection; I didn't participate in GSOC and still got selected.
Also, It is not guaranteed that you will receive a project in the same field as your GSoC project. The main goal is to assess your ability to complete the project successfully.

## Selection Email 
If you are selected you will receive an email of this type 
``
Dear ABC,
We are pleased to inform you that you have been proposed for selection for the technical Studentship
``

Congratulations to those who have been selected! Welcome to the place where the World Wide Web was invented. For those who were not selected, there are numerous openings and various programs at CERN. Please take a look at them.

Note:- Keeping this repository simple without the visa procedure and further details after selection. 

## My Experience 
While filling out the SmartRecruiters application, I simply added the experience details from my resume without making any changes. I was selected for the EP department, where my work primarily involved Full Stack and DevOps. Although most of my previous internships focused on machine learning, I also had some experience in full-stack development. As a result, there was an opening that matched my profile, and I was selected.

Many people ask me, "What do you think made you stand out?" Well, I believe there are several factors, and it's difficult to pinpoint just one. It could be my past experience or my research work. However, as I mentioned, my past experiences were somewhat related to ML. It's crucial to highlight and showcase your abilities rather than just your experience; otherwise, you may find yourself landing the same type of job repeatedly.
