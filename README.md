The job opening can be found on the official website of CERN Careers Page by [clicking here](https://careers.smartrecruiters.com/CERN/tech) 

### Required Qualifications 
In order to qualify for a place in the program you will need to meet the following requirements:

-   You are a **national of a [CERN Member or Associate Member State](http://home.cern/about/member-states)**.
-   You have completed **at least 18 months of your undergraduate studies** (Bachelor's or Masterâ€™s) at the time of the next student selection round taking place.
-   You **remain registered as a full-time student** during the internship.
-   You have a **good knowledge of English or French**.

### Required Documentation for Application
-   A  **CV**.
-   A copy of your **most recent academic transcript** giving an overview of your marks.
-   **A reference letter from your University Professor is  mandatory**.

### Selection Procedure After Application 

After the successful submission of an application, everyone receives an automated email from HR stating, "Your application is complete and is under review." You will typically receive this email after the deadline.

Following this, students are selected based on two categories:

1.  An interview is conducted for the majority of applicants. During my time, 4 out of 5 students selected from India received a selection email four months after the application deadline.
2.  An interview is not conducted for a few applicants. In my experience, only 1 out of 5 students was selected without an interview, receiving a selection email directly. However, it is highly unlikely that you will be selected if you do not receive an interview invitation.

For the interview, the questions are fairly straightforward and mainly involve a discussion about your resume and possibly the project the supervisor wants you to select.

It was also observed that most of the students selected from India for CS-related projects had made significant contributions to GSOC or other open source projects. However, that's not the only criteria for selection; I didn't participate in GSOC and still got selected.

### Selection Email 
If you are selected you receive an email of this type 
``
Dear ABC,
We are pleased to inform you that you have been proposed for selection for the technical Studentship
``

Congratulations to those who have been selected! Welcome to the place where the World Wide Web was invented. For those who were not selected, there are numerous openings and various programs at CERN. Please take a look at them.

Note:- Keeping this repository simple without the visa procedure and further details after selection.
